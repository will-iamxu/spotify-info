# spotify-info
This program is a very simple api project that pulls data from Spotify based on a user token and outputs song information

## Things to Consider:
-Only works for windows as of 4/8/2023 ( <br> )
-The application requires a valid client.txt file containing the client_id and client_secret for the Spotify API. This file should be placed in the same directory as the exe file. Follow the official [Spotify Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to set it up.
